# Website pishing classification
This project focuses on classifying websites as phishing, legitimate, or suspicious using machine learning techniques. The goal is to build a model that can accurately detect phishing websites based on various features extracted from their URLs and content.

## dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Phishing Websites Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/327/phishing+websites . This dataset collected mainly from: PhishTank archive, MillerSmiles archive, Googleâ€™s searching operators.

## goals
### Goal 1
Develop a machine learning model to accurately classify websites into phishing, legitimate, or suspicious categories.
### Goal 2
Identify the most important features that contribute to the detection of phishing websites.

## Insights
### Insight 1
Features like SSLfinal_State, URL_of_Anchor, and web_traffic are the most significant in distinguishing phishing websites from legitimate ones.
### Insight 2
The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 96.81%, demonstrating strong performance in classifying phishing websites.
